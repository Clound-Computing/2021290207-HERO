Fortunately, dermatologists have shared their top tips for relieving dry skin and keeping your skin hydrated and healthy.\n\n1. Keep your skin hydrated: One of the most important things you can do to relieve dry skin is to keep your skin hydrated. Drink plenty of water throughout the day, and consider using a humidifier in your home to add moisture to the air.\n2. Use a gentle cleanser: When washing your skin, it's important to use a gentle cleanser that won't strip your skin of its natural oils. Look for a cleanser that's labeled \"non-irritating\" or \"fragrance-free\" to avoid any potential irritation.\n3. Avoid hot showers: Taking hot showers can strip your skin of its natural oils, making it even drier. Opt for a warm shower instead, and be sure to rinse your skin thoroughly to avoid any residue.\n4. Moisturize regularly: Once you've washed your skin, it's important to apply a moisturizer to help lock in the moisture. Look for a moisturizer that's labeled \"hyaluronic acid\" or \"ceramides\" for added hydration and protection.\n5. Protect your skin from the sun: Exposure to the sun can cause dryness and irritation on your skin, so it's important to protect your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays.

However, not all sunscreens are created equal, and some may be more effective than others. Experts recommend avoiding sunscreens with a higher sun protection factor (SPF) than 50.\n\nThe SPF rating measures the amount of protection a sunscreen provides against UVB rays, which cause sunburns. A higher SPF rating indicates that the sunscreen provides more protection against UVB rays. However, it is important to note that SPF only protects against UVB rays, not UVA rays. UVA rays can cause damage to the skin's DNA, leading to premature aging and skin cancer.\n\nExperts recommend using sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher for protection against both UVB and UVA rays. Sunscreens with SPF 50 or higher provide additional protection against UVB rays, but they may not provide enough protection against UVA rays. In addition, higher SPF sunscreens can be more expensive and may contain more ingredients that can cause irritation or allergic reactions.\n\nIt is also important to choose a sunscreen that is broad-spectrum, meaning it protects against both UVB and UVA rays. Look for a sunscreen with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as the active ingredients, as these provide broad-spectrum protection.\n\nIn conclusion, while sunscreen with a higher SPF than 50 may provide additional protection against UVB rays, it is important to choose a sunscreen that is broad-spectrum and free from harsh chemicals. Experts recommend using sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher for daily use and higher SPFs for extended periods of outdoor activity.", "label": 0}, {"news_id": "gossipcop-844672", "title": "Zoe Saldana's Guardians Of The Galaxy character Gamora will appear in Avengers: Infinity War", "body_text": "Zoe Saldana's Guardians of the Galaxy character Gamora will appear in Avengers: Infinity War, the highly anticipated superhero crossover film.\n\nGamora, played by Saldana, is a skilled warrior and adopted daughter of the supervillain Thanos.

Don't wear anything that is deemed inappropriate: While the royal wedding is a formal event, it's still important to be respectful of the occasion. Avoid wearing anything that is deemed inappropriate, such as offensive or provocative clothing.\n3.
